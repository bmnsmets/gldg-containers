# GLDG Containers

This repository contains Docker/OCI images from the Geometric Learning & Differential Geometry research group of the TU Eindhoven.

- `/lietorch-ssh`: an Ubuntu-based image that includes `lietorch` and all its dependencies. Additionally the image runs an SSH server so that it can be used interactively (from VS Code for example) as a development container.
